# Computational-Physics
collection of physical related computational exercises

### Computational Physics:

**Computational Physics - Jos Thijssen**: an amazing book commonly cited in computational physics related papers. Has broad coverage on topics, but for now I am mainly focusing on DFT. 

**Computational Physics in Quantum Mechanics**:  

**Computational Quantum Mechanics - Joshua Izaac**: covers computational quantum mechanics topics in a practical way, writing numerical calculations both in *Fortran* and *Python* 

**Mastering Scipy - F.J. Silva**: learning scipy to better use it effectively in scientific computing. I have some difficulty in following the book though because some code doesn't work anymore 

**Modern Quantum Chemistry - A. Szabo, N. Oslund**: a good introduction into the hood of computational quantum chemistry

**Quantum Transport - Atoms to Transistors - Datta**:  learning the fundamental concepts in studying quantum transport in nanoelectronic system using Green's function

**Think Complexity - A. Downey**: simplest way to learn science of complex system
